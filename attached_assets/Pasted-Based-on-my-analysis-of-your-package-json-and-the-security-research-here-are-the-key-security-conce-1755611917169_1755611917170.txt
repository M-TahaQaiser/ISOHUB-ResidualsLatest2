Based on my analysis of your package.json and the security research, here are the key security concerns and recommendations:
Critical Security Issues:
1. Multer Version - HIGH RISK 🔴
You're using multer@2.0.2 - while this is above the vulnerable versions, ensure you're on the latest patch:

CVE-2025-47944 and CVE-2025-47935 affected versions 1.4.4-lts.1 through < 2.0.0
Your version (2.0.2) should be safe, but verify it's the latest 2.x version

2. BCrypt Version - MEDIUM RISK 🟡
You're using bcrypt@6.0.0 which is good:

Versions < 5.0.0 had critical vulnerabilities (password truncation and NUL character handling)
Your version is secure, but ensure proper salt rounds (10-12 recommended)

Security Best Practices Analysis:
✅ Good Security Choices:

Helmet (helmet@8.1.0) - Excellent for security headers
CORS (cors@2.8.5) - Proper cross-origin protection
Express Rate Limit (express-rate-limit@8.0.1) - DDoS protection
Express Validator (express-validator@7.2.1) - Input validation
Zod (zod@3.24.2) - Runtime type checking
JsonWebToken (jsonwebtoken@9.0.2) - Latest version (addresses past vulnerabilities)

⚠️ Potential Concerns:

Session Storage: You have express-session@1.18.1 and connect-pg-simple@10.0.0 - ensure proper session configuration:

Use secure cookies in production
Set appropriate session timeouts
Use HTTPS-only cookies


File Upload Security: With Multer, ensure you:

Validate file types strictly
Limit file sizes
Scan uploaded files
Store uploads outside web root


Database Dependencies:

mongodb@6.17.0 - Keep updated for security patches
@neondatabase/serverless@0.10.4 - Monitor for updates



Immediate Action Items:

Run npm audit:
bashnpm audit
npm audit fix

Update Dependencies: Check for newer versions of:

axios@1.10.0 (ensure latest patch)
ws@8.18.0 (WebSocket library - monitor for vulnerabilities)
uuid@11.1.0 (should be fine)


Security Configuration:
javascript// Ensure proper Helmet configuration
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      // Configure based on your needs
    }
  }
}));

// Secure CORS
app.use(cors({
  origin: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS?.split(',') || 'http://localhost:3000',
  credentials: true
}));

// Rate limiting
app.use(rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
}));


Additional Recommendations:

Environment Variables: Ensure sensitive data is in .env files
Input Validation: Use Zod schemas for all API endpoints
HTTPS Only: Force HTTPS in production
Security Headers: Configure CSP, HSTS, etc. through Helmet
Regular Audits: Set up automated dependency scanning

Your dependency choices show good security awareness. The main risks are keeping everything updated and proper configuration of the security middleware you already have installed.
